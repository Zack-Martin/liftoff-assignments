## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our project idea is to make a web app that allows event organizers to create and display upcoming events they are running. They will be able to add the details of there event, edit them if changes are needed, and also be able to remove the event once it is over. We also want to allow users to be able to make a volunteer account. These volunteer accoutns will be able to sign up to be a volunteer at events that organizers create. The event organizer would then be able to approve or disapprove these volunteers. We would also like to see if we can add a way for volunteers to receive automated emails reminding them of their upcoming events.

### Features
- Account registration: Users will be able to sign up as either an event organizer or a volunteer.
- Login/logout: Users will be able to login to interact with events. They will also be able to logout to end the session and protect their data.
- Search events: Users will be able to search for events through keywords/titles
- Volunteer sign up: Volunteer accounts will be able to register for events, then event organizers will be able to either approve or reject the application
